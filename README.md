## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm i`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
